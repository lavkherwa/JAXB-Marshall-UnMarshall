# JAXB-Marshall-UnMarshall

Very basic JAXB application for marshalling and un marshalling 

Current example shows how you can marshall and un marshall data. 

You would want to create classes from XML-Schema and vise-versa when dealing with SOAP services, there is a handly maven plugin which helps you achieve this, details of which can be found at below reference location ;)
